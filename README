About the project:

RIght now we have a basic convolution implementaton and a beginning in AVX.
AVX 3x3 conv is done (Simple version, should be faster).

The folder 'TemplateVersionProjectThing' is a convolution template which can be copied.
This can be done with basic as well, might be a eaier start.
./makefile contains the project directory specifications:
	#Project targets
	SUBDIRS = avx basic
Add any new project dir here.

Note: Binaries are not portable, recompilation is needed
		Due to -march=native flag in ./makefile
		THis is needed to enable AXV, and i want that variable in the basic project as well
		To elimitate any unneccecairy variables.


About the makefile:
This is my multi-project make file.

There are 3 fixed directories:
	-bin
	-headers
	-src
These directories can be made with 'make directories'
Going in to subdirectories required the make directories:
$(SUBDIRS): directories
	make command $@
So the directories will always be there.

These directories are shared between all projects.
Note that src does not contain any standalone project

project1 and project2 are example directories


in ./makefile:
	SUBDIRS denotes the project folders
	and all these directories are moved into and make is executed.
	
	The variables: bindir, common_source, common_libs and headers are passed
	to the submakefiles (eg. project1/makefile and project2/makefile)
	
	The commands all, debug, release and asm are avaiable.
	test is written as simple echo for some variables.
	
	all: calls release
	release: builds with specified release flags
	debug: builds with specified debug flags
	
	
In the SUBDIRS or the projects folders
	The makefile is independed if the common sources are not usesd.
	When building independendly, the binary will end in the same folder as the project.
	(eg. project1/binary)
	
	The commands all, debug, release and asm are prewritten. Also the variables from the root
	makefile are handled.
